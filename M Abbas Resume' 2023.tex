\section{Statement of Purpose}
I am a Computer Science Junior who is proficient with Git, GitHub and GitHub
Desktop. I have switched to Linux 6 months ago and I am very much comfortable
and proficient with terminal, therefore I'll enjoy assisting my fellow peers on
Git CLI, I have been using Windows since my childhood so I am also fluent with
GitHub Desktop. I have been managing my projects over GitHub for more than two
years and I deeply understand the git operations and functions. I try to keep
myself up-to-date with the new features and I have always been a curious guy
regarding the tools, languages and software I use therefore, I end up getting
so much comfortable with them, exploring the prolific features they offer.
